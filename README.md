This project focuses on building a real-time system for detecting, classifying, and tracking vehicles using advanced AI and computer vision techniques. By leveraging YOLOv8 for object detection and DeepSORT for tracking, the system ensures accurate and dynamic classification of vehicles from video streams.

# Features
Real-Time Processing: Efficient vehicle detection and tracking in video feeds.
Multi-Class Classification: Supports categories like bicycles, cars, buses, trucks, and more.
Dynamic Tracking: Uses Kalman filters and DeepSORT for consistent vehicle identification across frames.
Scalable Design: Adaptable to various traffic and environmental conditions.

# Technologies Used
Python
YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
OpenCV
DeepSORT

# How It Works
Input: Video streams or sequential images from traffic footage.
Detection: YOLOv8 identifies bounding boxes and classifies vehicles.
Tracking: DeepSORT ensures continuity of detection across frames.
Output: Annotated video with bounding boxes, labels, and vehicle counts.

This project was collaboratively developed by me, Vasudeva, Uday, Sharath.
